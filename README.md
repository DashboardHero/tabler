The same Tabler admin you know and love - easier to customize and work with. 
React, Angular and Vue are great technologies, but too complex for a project the size of an admin dashboard. 
This version of Tabler comes with components, folder-based routing and the same MIT license.

# Overview

React components are great - but React has a learning curve of at least 2 months. Often, developers need to showcase their work or launch an MVP in what little spare time they have.

Svelte components are just javascript, HTML(with some templating) and CSS. Things you know and understand. Moreover, you can go through the Svelte documentation in 30 minutes, and start working productively on your amazing admin dashboard the next 30.


## Components

Instead of working directly with HTML, work with components.

Instead of this:

Work with this:
```
<TopBar/>
<Nav />
<InnerPage title="Dashboard"/>
<div class="row row-deck">
   <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-3">
   <Card data = { data.getSalesCardData() } />
   </div>
</div>
...
```
## Folder-based routing(with multiple routes, for easy to understand public - Login/Register - layouts)

## Environment variables

## Single component rendering

## Easy deployment
